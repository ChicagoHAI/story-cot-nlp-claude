  title: Story CoT
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: "Training language models to use chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in\
    \ the form of human-like stories\u2014recounting memories or narrating ideas about\
    \ situations\u2014will result in different or improved performance compared to\
    \ standard CoT approaches, particularly on tasks such as physics problem modeling.\
    \ This approach may reveal whether models can produce story-like CoTs or if current\
    \ CoT methods exploit hidden patterns in large language models.\n"
  background:
    description: 'Current chain-of-thought (CoT) methods simulate a fuzzy reasoning
      process, but it is hypothesized that humans actually think in stories. This
      idea proposes training a model from base to post-training to use CoTs in the
      form of stories, similar to how people recount memories or narrate ideas about
      situations and their expected outcomes. The research questions whether this
      story-based CoT would perform better for certain tasks, such as physics problem
      modeling, and whether models are capable of producing such CoTs or if existing
      CoT methods leverage special hidden patterns in current large language models.
